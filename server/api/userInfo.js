// Provides routes to get and set user info for the user profile page

/**
 * The callback function for the /api/user/:user_id GET route. Gets a User's information.
 *
 * For security (and safety), this endpoint requires authorization.
 * The `:user_id` param is the user_id of the User whose information you want.
 * (e.g. `/api/user/1` would get the information for the User with user_id of 1.)
 * @param {Express.Request} req - The Request object generated by the route.
 * @param {Express.Response} res - The Response object generated by the route.
 * @param {Function} next - The next() function used in the callback.
 * @returns A JSON object in the response with the following structure:
 *  ```js
 *    {
 *      "username": "the user's username",
 *      "profile_picture": "a string-encoded binary blob of the profile picture",
 *      "profile_picture_top": the integer cropping point from the top of the image,
 *      "profile_picture_left": the integer cropping point from the left of the image,
 *      "best_times": [
 *        {
 *          "puzzle_id": the integer id of the puzzle,
 *          "name": "the name of the puzzle",
 *          "time": the integer representation of the time spent in milliseconds 
 *        },
 *        ...
 *      ]
 *    }
 *  ```
 *  For now, `best_times` will return all times, not just the best times.
